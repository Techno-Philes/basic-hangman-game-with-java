# basic-hangman-game-with-java

Tried a very basic version of the hangman game with java awt and swing. Did things from scratch this time :)


Will try to put up a better version (with more optimised and organised code) soon.


Building this gave me a very good understanding of the basic gui concepts. Hope looking at this and trying to build better version of this will help you too.
Have fun with the game and building it!


Any suggestions, comments and improvements are welcome.
